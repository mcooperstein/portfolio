# My Personal Website/Portfolio
This is my personal website/portfolio that features various websites and web applications that I have developed.

## Architecture and Design
I used bootstrap's "heroic-features" template to create the basic structure of my webpage. For my "hero image", I used a public image from Unsplash (uploaded by Abigail Keenan). I really liked how the black and white hero image looked next to the black navbar, so I decided to work with that color scheme throughout. I used a photo editor to make the rest of my images black and white, and then used basic CSS on the other elements to achieve this design.

## Additional Features/Functionality
I also added a smooth page-scroll effect, so that when the user clicks on any of the nav links, the page will scroll to that section of the page (as opposed to just jumping straight there). I also added modals for my portfolio projects, so that when the user clicks the "More Info" button, the corresponding project modal will display the relevant information.
